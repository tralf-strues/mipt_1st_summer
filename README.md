# First college assignment 
This is the first assignment I was given in college 🏫 (to be precise, it was in August, before the start of the new school year). Needless to say, <del>I'm not crying, I swear...</del> this will forever be one of the most memorable milestones of my life 😭 <del>(don't care how stupid it may sound)</del>.    

# About
The program solves quadratic equations in complex numbers (see the example below).

## Example:
### Solving the equation 
>=== Quadratic equation solver ===  
>=== Equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 ===  
>Enter the coefficients in the following format "a b c": 1 2 3 *("1 2 3" - user input)*  
>(1) * x2 + (2) * x + (3) = 0  
>Solution: x = -1 - 1.41421i OR x = -1 + 1.41421i  

### Testing the program
Being young and naive 🐣, I couldn't, it seems, make a debug mode, so each time you use the solver, it'll ask you whether to test the program or not 😄. 

>Do you want to test the program? Enter y - Yes, n - No:   

If you, for some reason, answer yes, then it'll run 11 pre-built tests to make sure everything works correctly.
